  The purpose of the website is to stand as a landing page for anyone interested in me, my professional work, and my passion projects. Whether it’s a recruiter or company looking through my portfolio, experience, and looking to contact me, or a friend interested in what I’ve been up to, or a fellow dev or user of one of my projects interested in contacting me, providing feedback, bug reporting, or feature requests, I want this page to accommodate everyone’s needs and reasons for checking it out.
  
	Technical requirements: I’m looking to make this website as accessible as possible. Ideally, in the footnotes of every project I create, I’m going to link to this site and / or direct github project link (if public) as a way to contact me or post issues.  Because it might be linked in mobile apps, it better be usable and presentable on mobile devices. This means not only making a mobile version of the site aesthetically, but making it safari functional as well as standard desktop browser friendly. Finally, since I’m looking to link to recruiters, and we all know how archaic office setups can be, I want it to be fairly accessible on old versions. Because of the breadth of use cases, functionally I’m looking to implement everything as well as I can in a low technologically complex environment. This has the side effect of leaning into a fast, clean loadout. Initially I’m deploying a v1 on netlify, but for a more independent environment, I’d ideally like to buy and push to my own domain. This requires a lot more complexity than the course offers, having to educate myself on security, traffic count and byte sizes for financial purposes.
  
	Content requirements: There are a ton of assets I need to get this up and running. From setting on a logo for the homepage and icon, to backgrounds and styling assets, to content itself. I’ve gone all in on this, treating it as the huge project that it should be for myself, and kinda pushed back barebones implementation in favor of site research and design. Everything I do is built upon the foundation of wireframing and hi-fi mockups, with design in mind to create even the base skeleton of the site. Content requirements needed beyond art assets are actual content, professional photos of me for the bio, statements, core projects and concise overviews about them for panels I’m going to create for each project under that segment. Logos for each external link I’m going to use, and unique styling for these logo assets. For example, in mouseovers for links such as GitHub and LinkedIn, I’m looking to create unique <strong> styling tags that look clean and have great user feedback. For the nav bar, I’m looking to have the same artstyle <strong> indicating the webpage that I’m currently on, and notably will use another styled version of the logo icon rather than just text that says “Home”. Likely I will implement placeholders for all of these and try to slowly implement during the iterative design process, since the content will be pushed on the backburner in favor of presenting core web dev skills for this course. The content will be created and implemented more in my free time, and I am looking to fully flesh it out over the holidays with more free time for a real, usable and publishable v1.  Additionally, I’m creating a design documentation folder in the project itself, designed to hold all of the development content, such as these design statements, lofi Miro boarding wireframes, visual site diagramming, persona diagrams, and eventually more high fidelity prototyping in figma. All of these will individually be found in https://github.com/Kevin-Klimek/Portfolio-Website/tree/main/specs and will be continually updated beyond the screenshots posted in this initial report.
